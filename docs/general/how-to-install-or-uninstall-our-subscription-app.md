# How to install or uninstall our Subscription app?

Before installing, your store must be using one of the following payment gateways: Shopify Payments, PayPal Express, Authorize.net, Stripe, Adyen on Shopify. Learn more about [**Shopify Subscriptions app eligibility considerations**](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/purchase-options/subscriptions/shopify-subscriptions/considerations).

### One-Step Installation

1. Open Theme Editor

2. Enable App Embed and Save

### Notes:

* We integrate with most of the themes in the Shopify theme
* When changing to a new theme, you just need to follow these steps again. It will let our app rework with your new one.
* Nothing will be visible to customers until you assign products to the subscription group.
* If you need to uninstall our app, just click "Uninstall" as usual. Our app uses Shopify Theme App extensions, so there is no leftover code on your theme.
