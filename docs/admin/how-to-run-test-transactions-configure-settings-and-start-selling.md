# How to run test transactions, configure settings, and start selling?



> **Remember that: our Subscriptions & Recurring Pay app now just work with Shopify Payments**

Please follow these steps to test everything before launching:

### Step 1: Setting up Shopify Payments for your store <a href="#step-1-setting-up-shopify-payments-for-your-store" id="step-1-setting-up-shopify-payments-for-your-store"></a>

* Please follow this detailed guide of Shopify: [https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/setting-up-shopify-payments](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/setting-up-shopify-payments)
* Refer to this guide in case you need credit card information for testing: [https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/testing-shopify-payments](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/testing-shopify-payments)

### Step 2: Duplicating an existing product to test your new payment <a href="#step-2-duplicating-an-existing-product-to-test-your-new-payment" id="step-2-duplicating-an-existing-product-to-test-your-new-payment"></a>

You can keep it **UNPUBLISHED**, so it's not visible to customers during testing process.

### Step 3: Assign your testing product to Subscription Plan <a href="#step-3-assign-your-testing-product-to-subscription-plan" id="step-3-assign-your-testing-product-to-subscription-plan"></a>
