# How do Shopify customers manage their subscriptions?

Your customers can access this URL to manage their subscription contracts:

```
https://YOUR-DOMAIN/apps/subscription/contracts
```

For instance, you can access [our demo store here (password: 1)](https://bss-subscriptions-app.myshopify.com/account) and sign in using the test account. You will see the subscriptions here

And here is the subscription detail

On the subscription detail page, customers can:

* In General:
  * PAUSE / CANCEL or ORDER the NEXT CYCLE immediately
  * Update payment metnod
* In Upcoming orders: SKIP CYCLE

THAT'S GREAT, RIGHT? :tada: To be even more convenient for your customers to access the Customer Portal, you can contact us to add an additional link in the Account Detail Page, like this :clap:
